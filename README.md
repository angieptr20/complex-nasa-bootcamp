# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. 

Tech used:

âœ… HTML, âœ… CSS, âœ… JavaScript, âœ… Nasa Api, âœ… Wikipedia Api

This is one of the coolest designs out of all my projects with api integration!

Lesson learned: Reading documentation is a skill and with patience, you can achieve anything!
